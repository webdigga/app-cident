						<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
						<p>After seeing a van driver involved in an accident have to manually fill out lots and lots of paperwork and take a photo with a throw away camera, we thought we could come up with a much quicker, semi automated, more dynamic approach to save the drivers time, the companies time and also to save money.</p>
						<p>It's inconvenient for the driver, will require another employee to process and doesn't make any use of a regular everyday smartphone.</p>
						<p>We decided something could be done to solve this. We decided to get a team together to build a prototype to see if the idea is viable. We are all youngish professionals with heaps of experience in our sectors, from the system architect to the front end developer to the marketing executive.</p>
						<p>The App-cident team formed in 2012 to start building an App and backend Console from which to analyse their data and keep track of everything.</p>
						<p>Initially the app was very simple and recorded the most impotant pieces of information and bit by bit it grew with new features aimed at improving how the company could track what was happening with any accidents involving their vehicles.</p>
						<p>What we want is to provide an easy to use application for your drivers to use on the go, easily customizable to your needs. We will also provide a strong administrative console to speed the follow up process with insurances/third parties.</p>					
						<h2>CORE FEATURES</h2>
